A Flutter Based project on Comparision of Dead Reckoning And SLAM


In this project, we focus on two widely used localization techniques: Dead Reckoning 
(DR) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Both techniques aim to 
estimate the current position of a robot or user, but they work in very different ways. 

To understand these techniques clearly, we developed a Flutter-based mobile 
application that shows how position is tracked over time. The application visually 
displays movement paths, making it easy to see how errors occur and how accuracy 
differs between DR and SLAM. The purpose of this project is not only to implement 
these techniques, but also to understand their practical behavior through visual 
output.
